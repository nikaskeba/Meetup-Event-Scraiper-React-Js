We are going off-book again for this one since the weather can make some of the drives out of the area dodgy. We'll be hiking at Coal Creek Trail in Bellevue and raising a glass at Chainline Taproom in Kirkland. (Sorry...I'm not brave enough to try to get us all into an Irish Pub on the 17th!) The hike is 5 miles out-and-back (so will be hard for us to get lost lol) It's considered a moderate hike with a couple good up and down hills (567 ft elevation gain) -- and it can get muddy, so plan accordingly. As always, well socialized, leashed dogs (and Leprechauns) are welcome on the trail. (I'm checking on brewery rules for pups.) And, of course...if you get waitlisted for the hike, feel free to join us at the brewery for a beer around 12:30. +11",

We'll explore the analogy of having fun on a swing. A little push gets you swinging. With the right timing, additional little pushes get you swinging even higher. It's the same in budding friendships. Following up at the right time can build or maintain the momentum. We'll focus on applying this to a single instance of spending time with someone, focusing on how to create more momentum with light, low pressure invitations. From engaging in new topics in a conversation, to going for a walk after having a meal, or going for a meal after an activity, all these moments give us a chance to \"push the swing\" together to build more momentum in the friendship This is a \"dry run\" event.

We will start by taking an inventory of our relationships and identifying the areas we're looking to add to our life. We will briefly discuss close relationships (romantic partnerships, support networks) but focus primarily on lighter forms of friendship (companions, activity buddies, potential close friends). It helps to know what you have room for in your life. Second, we'll spend sometime discovering the intersection between what we have to offer (skills, experiences, expertise) and what we want to offer. These will usually be passions or interests and will serve as potential points of connection. Finally, we will practice gently weaving in our interests, passions, and other potential points of connection into conversations. We will do this by mentioning these things without diving into too much detail, so that our conversation partner can choose to follow up if they are curious, interested or experienced in that area, without cornering them or over sharing if they're not.

In this session you'll partner with someone roleplaying a shy person that wants to talk to you but keeps running out of things to say. By taking charge and leading the conversation, you'll make the experience much more fun for both of you and face some of your own insecurities about these potentially awkward situations. Then we'll switch to roleplaying and anxious person that can't stop talking. The more they talk, the more they worry and the more they worry the more they talk. The way to help here is to interrupt and contribute to the conversation. It's going to feel like getting onto an escalator or those crazy elevators that don't have doors and don't stop on the floors. Expect these exercises to bring up some insecurities. You might feel like you are making the shy partner uncomfortable or that you're being rude to the anxious partner. Rest assured that being able to handle these situations better will make things more comfortable for you and your conversation partners in the future. This is a \"dry run\" event.

They're all one-on-one interactions where almost all of the attention is on you. They're easy to schedule and plan, but when following up with a new acquaintance for the first time, they require a higher level of comfort with talking and rejection. We'll start by reviewing our top one or two favorite coffee shops, casual dining places and parks. If you don't have one, you'll be invited to make a short list of places to explore in your area. Having places you enjoy in mind will make it that much less stressful to invite someone out to continue getting to know them. We'll then spend some time exploring the seemingly innocent yet sometimes intimidating \"tell me a little about yourself\". We'll practice responding in a way that invites people to follow up on things you care about while acknowledging but drawing attention away from things people commonly pry into but that have little to do with how you are. Finally we'll practice asking and answering the question in one on one practice. Remember to express interest and ask follow up questions, even if you're the one being invited to talk. Many people are secretly hoping that you'll ask them about themselves and sincerely listen to what they have to say. This is a \"dry run\" event. It's one of the first times we're hosting it.

                "description": "Rejection sucks. Let's get better with it. Rejection is an inevitable part of social interaction. If you put yourself out there, you will eventually experience people avoiding eye contact or making up an excuse to walk away from an interaction. You're not going to be everybody's cup of tea. Even if you were, they may have something else on their mind. None of this is news to anyone. That doesn't make it hurt any less. Most trainings I've attended have dealt with this by saying \"don't let it bother you\" and \"the more you avoid it, the more sensitive you will become\" with the ultimate solution being to \"just do it anyway\". That takes a tremendous amount of willpower and courage. It's valid, but has the potential to make things worse if they go poorly. We don't have to be so extreme. In this session, we will roleplay scenarios where you personally would chose to reject someone that was approaching you. By practicing rejecting, we hope to loosen up some of feelings of injustice that we might feel when we get rejected. You will have a choice about whether you want to participate in the exercises and at what intensity. We will only stick to the types of rejection you'd face as a mild mannered person in a public setting, but please be gentle with yourself. This is a \"dry run\" event.

Talking to someone who looks friendly at a potluck, mixer or house party is low pressure. Our intention will set the stakes. To make it low stakes, our intention will be to simultaneously a) learn about the person we're talking to and b) share what we feel comfortable with about ourselves. It's not to get them to like us, sell them anything, or convince them of something we believe in. During the conversation you might find common interests, passions or activities. Or you might not. Either outcome is a win. Our goal is to learn to relax and maybe even feel playful while having these types of conversations.

                "description": "Join us on Thursday March 21st, for New Tech\u2019s ADHD Oasis Meetup: Managing Rejection Sensitive Dysphoria Register here.(Register through Meetup does not reserve your spot) March 21st Hot Topic \u2013 Managing Rejection Sensitive DysphoriaUnderstanding and managing rejection sensitive dysphoria (RSD) is really important, especially for adults with ADHD who might struggle with emotional regulation. RSD can cause intense pain in response to feeling rejected or criticized, and it\u2019s tough because traditional therapies might not always help. People with RSD tend to have strong emotional reactions to negative feedback or feeling left out, and others might see them as being overly sensitive or perfectionistic. During this meetup we will talk about signs of RSD and ways to find personalized strategies that really make a difference in how it affects everyday life and happiness. Check out these articles before the meetup: You are not alone.Come join a community of peers where you can safely discuss yourneurodiverseexperiences with a supportive community of peers once month. You can attend these virtual Meetups on the third Thursday of every month. The more Meetups you attend, the more peer connections you\u2019ll make with other professionals who have neurodiverse brains like you. Instead of being lonely in your experience, come laugh, learn, and connect with your community. Join us to be welcomed into a community that gets you and lives with similar neurodiverse brains. During the Meetups we\u2019ll share struggles as well as systems and strategies to overcome your executive functioning and working memory challenges like anxiety, overwhelm, miscommunication, interrupting, inattentiveness, stress, distractibility, procrastination, paperwork fails, imposter syndrome, having to mask your neurodiversity at work, and weak organization skills. The CommunityProfessionals in technology who are managing ADHD, ADD, autism, dyslexia, depression, anxiety, or other neurodivergent conditions.

You\u2019ll laugh, smile, and exhale the stresses around living in a neuerotypically-designed world and work places.

                "description": "InCosmic Encounter, you are the leader of one of dozens of alien races, each with its own unique power. On your turn, you'll attempt to gain a colony in a random player's home system through force or negotiation. Each side will deploy forces, gather allies, secretly commit encounter cards, and then it's glory to the victor and woe to the loser, unless one side -- or both! -- plays special cards from their hands or uses their alien power to upset the victory or punish the winner. Players must use the right combination of force, cunning, and diplomacy to ensure victory. Alliances form and shift from moment to moment, so your nemesis can become your closest comrade with the flip of a card. And because alliances are a key part of the game, multiple players can win together. Will you go for a joint win? Or will you try to pull out a solo victory? On a personal note, I've probably played this game more than any other boardgame in my life. I've had some of my most fun moments around a gaming table with it. I will teach the game -- no experience needed. If you haven't played before, please try to show up a few minutes early for a quick introduction. The game is pretty easy to learn (rated 2.58/5.00 on boardgamegeek, where 3.00 is medium difficulty). Playtime varies based on the number of players, alien power combinations, and other factors, but we should be able to get in multiple rounds. I'll cancel if we don't get at least four people for the event, as Cosmic Encounter is not much fun at 3 players or less. For more information, including teaching videos, there are resources available on Boardgamegeek.com:Game info:https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/39463/cosmic-encounter Cosmic Encounter in about 3 minutes:https://boardgamegeek.com/video/378447/cosmic-encounter/cosmic-encounter-about-3-minutes...It outlines the basics of the rules but unfortunately doesn't really show the back-and-forth of the game.

The series follows the adventures of Taran the Assistant Pig-Keeper, a youth raised by Dallben the enchanter, as he nears manhood while helping to resist the forces of Arawn Death-Lord. Inspired by Welsh mythology, The Book of Three has been a long favorite children's novel. The Book of Three and its successor, The Black Cauldron, were loosely adapted by Walt Disney Productions and released in 1985 as Disney's 25th animated feature film, under the latter title. (Not recommended by this Event Host.) I'll leave it open to have discussions about the whole Chronicles of Prydain series. The Chronicles of Prydain is a pentalogy of children's high fantasy Bildungsroman novels. The series includes: The Book of Three (1964), The Black Cauldron (1965), The Castle of Llyr (1966), Taran Wanderer (1967), and The High King (1968). The Black Cauldron earned a 1966 Newbery Honor, and The High King won the 1969 Newbery Medal. ******** From the earliest days, tabletop roleplaying games have been designed to empower players to create and interact with stories modeled after literary fiction. Look at Appendix N from the Dungeon Master's Guide (p. 244, E. G. Gygax 1979), A Cyberpunk Bibliography from Cyberpunk 2020 (p. 187, M. Pondsmith 1990), Hiding Your Sources from Vampire: the Masquerade (p. 258, M. Rein-Hagen 1991), or the list you'll probably find towards the back of your favorite RPG. This month we're reading The Book of Three by Lloyd Alexander. Feel free to read the entire series. In my opinion, in the early days of D&D, high fantasy book series were few (not counting pulp series by authors like Burroughs or Howard), and I put JRR Tolkien, Lloyd Alexander, and CS Lewis as the foundations of the genre. Come join us to talk about the plot, characters, and themes of the book, or maybe what aspects of it you would want to borrow for your games! I hope to see you there!

                "location": "Green Lake Park & Ride, Seattle, WA",
                "description": "IntroductionThe enchantments is a captivating paradise in WA that everyone should visit once. Nature has carved one of the magnificent places of this world--an alpine paradise of granite worn smooth by glaciers, larches manicured by wind and cold, and crystal blue lakes strung together by a creek that tumbles and thunders between them. Seemingly everywhere, herds of mountain goats calmly wander by. Superlatives simply don\u2019t suffice, and you quickly find yourself resorting to otherworldly comparisons, just like the early visitors who bestowed place names like Aasgard, Sprite and Leprechaun on the fairytale surroundings. Since this is early May, we won't need a permit for the core zone of enchantments. I plan for us to travel to core zone on the 1st day and camp there. 2nd day we will get up early, pack up everything and hike all the way to snowlake. Passes Needed ScheduleMy current plan is to meet at Green Lake Park & Ride early to drive out. If you want to meet at Trailhead we can arrange that but I might ask you to arrange to pick a rider to bring with you. We will all start at hiking at Stuart/Colchuck Lake Trailhead and setup camp at Core Zone the first night. Then 2nd day wake up early around 7am, pack up by 8am, and hike to the Snowlake Trailhead. This means we will need to all drive to Snowlake Trailhead and park 2 of our cars at Snowlake Trailhead. The 2 cars will carry all 8 of us to from Snowlake Trailhead parking to Stuart/Colchuck Lake Trailhead. When we finish at Snowlake Trail then we can take the 2 cars we parked there and drive them to Stuart/Colchuck Lake Trailhead to pick up the 2 cars we have there. Then we drive back home. This means we need at least 4 drivers and preferably 6 for backup. This means 6 out of the 8 people who will be allowed will be drivers. I intentionally built in lots of extra time by starting early to make it safer for everyone so we can do it before it gets dark. It also allows us time to take pictures. This schedule gives us lots of backup time but likely we will be able to go faster than what is shown below. My hope is we can be faster on the first day so we can check out Horseshoe Lake.

To see where we're running this week, see our route map & schedulehere. We run year-round, in rain or shine, and despite what you see in the RSVP list, we've been averaging ~60 runners a week. First-timers are always welcome, as are any out-of-town visitors looking for a fun group of runners! We try to make sure that everyone arrives safely back to port: many of us know all of the routes, we have laminated mini route maps available at the start, and we usually have sweepers running near the back. Pace-wise, the group typically ranges from 7:30 to 10:30 minutes per mile. Most of our routes have a photo stop, usually about halfway, where everyone regroups. If you're looking for something a little shorter or longer, or something stroller-friendly, just ask us for some shortcut, add-on, or detour suggestions. On-leash dogs are also welcome. Questions? Just ask! We want your first Wednesday Night Run to be a success! We start meeting up at 5:20pm at the Brooks Trailhead store at 3400 Stone Way in Seattle's Fremont neighborhood (depending on the weather, we may be inside the store). At 5:35pm, we have introductions, describe the route, and take off. We finish back at the store. Afterward, most of us head across the street toFremont Brewing, where we hang out and socialize (it's kid and dog friendly). They have tasty craft beer and cider on tap, as well as some non-alcoholic choices (they have very limited food options, however). They have indoor and covered outdoor seating (heaters when it's cold, misters when it's hot). If you can't make the 5:30pm run (timing, rest day, injury, whatever), you are definitely welcome to meet us at the brewery. We're usually there by 6:30pm; just look for the runners! If you need to use the restroom or lockers to store your stuff during the run, the Brooks Trailhead store has both inside. Keep in mind that the store closes at 7pm.

We start with a warm-up drill where we climb for about 4-5 minutes using different leg variations to get blood flowing. Then we go freestyle for about 30-45 mins. Freestyle here means running up the stairs, walking, jogging, crawling, squad-jumping, frog-jumping,.... however you want to do it as long as you're climbing up the stairs. You'll probably get sore afterwards if you haven't done a stair workout before or it has been a while since you did one but don't let that stop you. Your body will adapt pretty fast if you do it consistently. Strong, powerful, legs/lower-body, burn serious calories, get your heart-rate up-- all in 30-45 mins From the bottom(Lakeview Boulevard) to the top(10th Ave E), there are 13 flights of stairs that gives you a total of 282 steps.

We do not have a reserved table (since they do not take reservations) but there should be plenty of space.

This event is hybrid event see the \"Code Katas with Seattle JS Hackers\" event page for in-person location Code Katas are a fun way to do coding exercises, inanylanguage you want. It's a good practice to keep increasing your skills as a coder. You can practice the same kata over and over to continue improving, get feedback from others, and move on to more difficult problems to solve. This will be a structured event where we will present the kata, and how to practice them, then everyone works to solve the problem on your own computer, get help from neighbors and mentors, and see how others solve the same problem! 5:45 - code ninjas arrive and socialize6:00 - intro, present format and prep6:10 - round 1 - warm up6:45 - round 2 - challenge yourself!8:00 - wrap up We organize coding sessions at venues in Seattle each week. Our sessions encourage peer ideation, knowledge sharing, new champions for causes and projects, and a heightened sense of community. If you have a cool project, work on it with us! This is a perfect time to start your code ninja career! We have a wide range of experience levels, and some of us love to teach (because you usually learn something when you teach, right?) So don't be afraid. Come on over. Seattle JS Hackers is a space for judgement-free learning and collaboration. We seek to support and encourage our members in a positive way; even negative feedback should be offered constructively and with respectful words. Please feel free to share your experiences with others (e.g., product, company, passion, recruitment opportunity) if asked, but save your sales pitches for other events. Remember, we are here to grow, learn, hack, and help each other!

At 9:45AM we will depart for the short walk down the Crocket Street stairs to the NWOC dock and start the paddle at 10:15AM. If you plan on renting your paddle craft, the most convenient option is the NWOC located on the dock we launch from. More info on NWOC hourly rentals at this link https://www.nwoc.com/rental/ From a logistics standpoint, rather than parking at the Swedish Club it is easier to first park at the NWOC dock at Crocket Street & Westlake--plenty of free parking--then walk up the stairs and one block south (left at the top of the stairs) to the Swedish Club at 1920 Dexter Ave N. Please dress and equip appropriately for whatever conditions we encounter on the lake. See you then! ***Anyone interested in volunteering at the Swedish Club Pancake Breakfast, you can do so by emailing Stacy Martens at stacey@swedishclubnw.org or call 206-283-1090. You don't need to be a member and there is a free breakfast in it for you, in addition to volunteering alongside a group of fun people. But make sure you volunteer for the early shift so you don't miss the paddle. And make sure to come to the kitchen and say hello to me. I'll be frying Swedish pancakes on the big grill. ***While you're on the NWOC dock be sure to check out their deals & specials on kayak & SUP gear https://www.nwoc.com/shop/ and their classes & trips https://www.nwoc.com/classes/default.asp?page=classes___________________________________________________ABOUT THE LAKE UNION PANCAKE PADDLE Eat Swedish pancakes. Then paddle. Beginners are most welcome. If you don't own a kayak, SUP or canoe, they can be rented by the hour at the dock we launch from. This group is open to all paddle craft (kayaks, SUPs, canoes, inflatables, dragon boats, etc.) and gathers regularly at 9AM on the first Sundays of every month in the lobby of the Swedish Club which is open to the public for their monthly Swedish pancake breakfasts. We enjoy the ten million dollar view and have a Swedish pancake breakfast together to the accompaniment of live Scandinavian folk music. Then we take the short walk down to the dock and leisurely paddle for an hour or so on the placid urban waters of Lake Union, the most unique lake in the world--home to Academy award winning movies, amazing houseboats, historic vessels & sunken battleships, storied Olympic champions, Native American history, stupendous infrastructure, a surprising amount of wildlife and the birthplace of the Boeing Airplane Co. We also do \"Special Edition\" paddles on the lakes and rivers of Western & Central Washington and on Puget's Sound, the Pacific Coast and the San Juans. Special Edition paddles often have no onsite rental availability. +4",
